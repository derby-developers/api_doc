# Introduction

For API access, please contact eric@derbygames.com. You will be issued a application name, client ID, and client secret.

# Interacting with the API

## Making Requests

All requests:

* must be over HTTPS
* must have an application name, either as a header 'Application-Name' or as a query string 'application_name'

Arguments can be passed as params, form data or JSON with correct `Content-Type` header.

## Localization

There is limited support for localization using the `Accept-Language` header. Currently, we allow:

* `en` - English (default)
* `es` - Spanish
* `pt` - Portuguese (Brazil)

Any non supported locale will default to English.

Numbers, currency and datetime donâ€™t rely on localization so they will be returned in standard format.

## Versioning

This document applies to V1, which is the current live version. To maintain compatibility with this version, it is recommended you add an accepts header:

`Accept: version=1`

## Objects

Any field not explicitly listed should be avoided as it is subject to change.

  "video_duration_seconds":81
}
```

Field | Description
----- | -----------
video_url | URL of the video (link expires in 5 minutes)
video_duration_seconds | total length, in seconds

## Viewing Video

> Example

```curl
curl -H "Application-Name: super-fun-game" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ABC123" \
  https://api.derbygames.com/api/instant_racing/races/<RACE_ID>/video?quality=low
```

`GET /instant_racing/races/<RACE_ID>/video?quality=[low|high|hls]`

'low' and 'high' will be an MP4. HLS will return a m3u8 playlist.

<aside class="notice">
A race must be decided to get a video URL, otherwise null will be returned. Video must also be requested within 5 minutes of being decided.
</aside>


# Instant Racing: Example Flow

Below is an example of the endpoints you need to get a race, wager on the race, view the video, then see the results.

## 1. Get a User & Credits

First, you'll need a user token that has credits. If you need to, you can generate a guest user with the example to the right.

> Token Example

```curl
curl -X POST -H "Application-Name: racechamp_mobile_app" \
  --d "grant_type=guest&device_id=some-unique-device-id" \
  https://api.derbygames.com/api/oauth/token
```

> Bonus Example

```curl
curl -H "Application-Name: super-fun-game" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ABC123" \
  -d "bonus_name=instant_racing_refill" \
  https://api.derbygames.com/api/awarded_bonuses
```

If that user does not have credits, you can award the refill bonus. You will want the _instant_racing_refill_ bonus.


## 2. Get a Race

Races are user specific and this endpoint will continue to serve the same race until the decide endpoint is called.

> Example

```curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ABC123" \
  -H "Application-Name: racechamp_mobile_app" \
  https://api.derbygames.com/api/instant_racing/races/current
```

## 3. Place a Wager

> Example

```curl
curl -H "Application-Name: racechamp_mobile_app" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ABC123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "amount": 10, "race_id": "<RACE_ID>"}' \
  https://api.derbygames.com/api/instant_racing/super_slot_spins
```

Place a Super Slot wager.

## 4. Decide the Race

> Example

```curl
curl -X PUT -H "Application-Name: racechamp_mobile_app" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ABC123" \
  https://api.derbygames.com/api/instant_racing/races/<RACE_ID>/decide
```

Close wagering and enqueue a job to calculate wager payoffs.

## 5. Get the Video URL

> Example

```curl
curl -H "Application-Name: racechamp_mobile_app" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ABC123" \
  https://api.derbygames.com/api/instant_racing/races/<RACE_ID>/video?quality=low
```

Video must be requested within 5 minutes of hitting the decide endpoint.

## 6. Get Wager Payoffs

> Example

```curl
curl -H "Application-Name: racechamp_mobile_app" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ABC123" \
  https://api.derbygames.com/api/instant_racing/races/<RACE_ID>/wagers
```

Wagers will have payoff_amounts now.

## 7. Get Updated Account Balance

The balance would be updated a few seconds after the decide enpoint was called, but you should avoid changing the users balance until the video is over to avoid spoilers.

> Example

```curl
curl -H "Application-Name: racechamp_mobile_app" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ABC123" \
  https://api.derbygames.com/api/accounts
```

# Chat & Realtime Data Stream

You can connect to our streaming servers for chat and realtime data. This method is recommended over polling other endpoints. Talk to the nerds for more information.
